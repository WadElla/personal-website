title: Smart Irrigation System powered by Deep Learning algorithms
summary: Trained an LSTM deep learning model to predict rainfall patterns for Kumasi. Built an efficient and smart irrigation to converse water using predictions from the deep learning model. Created a mobile app to provide real-time farm data to the farmer.The system was very efficient in conversing water. 
 An example of using the in-built project page.
